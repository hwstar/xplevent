xplevent is a program which reponds to xPL trigger messages, and executes
a tiny perl-like language to send xPL commands. It also keeps track of
heartbeat messages received from other xPL devices and it updates a 
sqlite3 data base with this information.

This is a program in the very early stages of its development. It is nowhere
near complete.

It can be run as a daemon, or in the foreground. There are command line options
to select the, log file, debug level, and broadcast interface. For a complete
list of command line options, type ./xplevent --help once the program is built.

To compile xplevent, compile and install xPLLib on your system first. 
Make sure you have talloc-devel and sqlite3-devel installed as well.

xplevent is a program which reponds to xPL trigger messages, and executes
a tiny perl-like language to send xPL commands. It contains a built in scheduler
to send xPL commands on a certain time/date or an event like sunrise, sunset,
dusk, dawn, or startup. The scheduler uses cron-like expressions to trigger
scripts to be executed. 

The database keeps track of the most recent heartbeat and trigger messages
received. The database also contains a trigger table which matches trigger
messages to an appropriate script to execute. The scripts are stored
in the database to keep them in one central location. 

This is a program in development. It is nowhere near complete.

It can be run as a daemon, or in the foreground. There are command line options
to select the, log file, debug level, and broadcast interface. For a complete
list of command line options, type ./xplevent --help once the program is built.
